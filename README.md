# SAI Implementation in C++
### Purpose 
The purppose of this repository is ultimately to create a parallel implementation for SAI and SAM. 
### Files In Repository
In this repository, there are several C++ and MATLAB files. The MATLAB files are from Professor Arielle Carr's PhD paper on SAM. 
The C++ files were created to implement Dr. Carr's work in a different language. The header files were created to describe different
processes and were then #included in the SAI_cpp.cpp file.
