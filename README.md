# SAI Implementation in C++
### Purpose 
The purpose of this repository is ultimately to create a parallel implementation for SAI and SAM. Trhoughout this semester of my independent study, I have done a lot of work learning about Sparse Approximate Inverse (SAI) and Sparse Approximate Maps (SAM). This project will continue next semester to parallelizing the algorithms and move from an SAI application to an SAM application. 
### Files In Repository
In this repository, there are several C++ and MATLAB files. The MATLAB files are from Professor Arielle Carr's PhD paper on SAM. 
The C++ files were created to implement Dr. Carr's work in a different language. The header files were created to describe different
processes and were then #included in the SAI_cpp.cpp file.
